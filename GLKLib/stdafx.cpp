// stdafx.cpp : source file that includes just the standard includes

// stdafx.obj will contain the pre-compiled type information

#include "stdafx.h"

// The 'stdafx.h' header file is a precompiled header file that is included at the beginning
// of this source file. It contains standard system and project-specific include files
// that are required for the compilation of this source file.

// The precompiled header file is used to improve compile times by allowing the compiler
// to skip processing the included headers that have not changed since the last compilation.
// The precompiled header file is compiled into a binary file (.pch) that is then linked
// with this source file during compilation.

// TODO: reference any additional headers you need in STDAFX.H
// and not in this file. Any additional headers that are required for this source file
// should be added to the STDAFX.H header file.
