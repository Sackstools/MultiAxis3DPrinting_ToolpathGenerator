// MOC_PREDEFS.H.CBT: This file contains preprocessor definitions generated by the
// Meta Object Compiler (MOC) for Qt applications. These definitions are used to
// enable Qt's meta-object system, which provides features such as signals and slots,
// property system, and runtime type information.


// DUMMY.CPP: This is a dummy implementation file provided by Qt's build system.
// It is typically used as a placeholder for actual source code files that have not
// yet been implemented or are not yet available. The file contains a basic C++
// program structure with a main function, but does not contain any meaningful
// functionality.
